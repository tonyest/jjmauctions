Prospress - eStore child theme.
Custom eStore child theme to integrate custom behaviours with Prospress auction place.
2011 Anthony Khoo.

This theme requires Prospress version 1.0.3 or later (1.0.3 to be released specifically to JJmauctions)

Updates v 1.0

- Theme changes restructured to work more extensibly as a Wordpress 'child-theme' for Elegant Designs' eStore theme.
- Fix to query structure allowing pagination on index pages.
- Re-worked scroller.php to use get_posts instead of query_posts. Using query_posts outside of "the loop" and causes erratic behaviours with Prospress and potentiall other plugins.
- Re-arranged single post pages fixing some bugs and improving overall 'flow'
- css fix in .content width to prevent eStore scroller mis-aligning.
- Bid history
- Preparation for Shipping details
- Modification to allow scroller shown on Prospress Index page.
- Fixed modified scroller bug which was limited to 5 items.
